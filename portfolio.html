        <p>Here you can see some of the projects I've done (the wider boxes). These 3 projects below were all for
            educational purposes.</p>
        <p>The smaller boxes represent some courses I've followed to get a better idea of my interests.</p>

            <h3>Recreate an Old Retro Game</h3>
            <p>Together with 5 other students we've recreated an old retro game. This was created with C# and MonoGame
                in Visual
                Studio. Features: online/offline multiplayer, highscores, play against the computer. This is created in
                10
                weeks.

            <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Classification, Reinforcement Learning, Path Planning algorithms, Bayesian Networks and much more.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Multithreaded Programming</h3>
            <p>Such as programming on the GPU with OpenCL.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Information Retrieval and Data Mining</h3>
            <p>This included building a search engine for cars with techniques such as term frequency, inverse document
                frequency and Jaccard index.</p>

            <h3>Webshop</h3>
            <p>My first client-server application: a webshop where you can browse, filter and buy products (not for
                real, but the idea remains the same). You could also create an account and login with that account.
                Created with
                Jade, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js and AJAX. Created in approximately 3 weeks in
                groups of two.</p>

        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Datastructures</h3>
            <p>Learned all kinds of search algorithms such as quicksort, counting sort, selection-sort and bitwise
                operations and how to program efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Small game in Haskell</h3>
            <p>Created in 4/5 weeks in groups of two. Haskell is not the most ideal for game development, but this was
                a mandatory
                requirement.</p>

        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Software Design</h3>
            <p>Learned some useful design patterns such as Facade, Adapter, Strategy, Bridge, Abstract Factory,
                Decorator and Observer.</p>
