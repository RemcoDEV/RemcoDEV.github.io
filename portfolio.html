        <p>Here you can see some of the projects I've done (the wider boxes). These 3 projects below were all for
            educational purposes.</p>
        <p>The smaller boxes represent some courses I've followed to get a better idea of my interests.</p>

            <h3>Recreate an Old Retro Game</h3>
            <p>Together with 5 other students we've recreated an old retro game. This was created with C# and MonoGame
                in Visual
                Studio. Features: online/offline multiplayer, highscores, play against the computer. This is created in
                10
                weeks.
            </p>

        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Classification, Reinforcement Learning, Path Planning algorithms, Bayesian Networks and much more.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Multithreaded Programming</h3>
            <p>Such as programming on the GPU with OpenCL.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Information Retrieval and Data Mining</h3>
            <p>This included building a search engine for cars with techniques such as term frequency, inverse document
                frequency and Jaccard index.</p>

            <h3>Webshop</h3>
            <p>My first client-server application: a webshop where you can browse, filter and buy products (not for
                real, but the idea remains the same). You could also create an account and login with that account.
                Created with
                Jade, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js and AJAX. Created in approximately 3 weeks in
                groups of two.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Datastructures</h3>
            <p>Learned all kinds of search algorithms such as quicksort, counting sort, selection-sort and bitwise
                operations and how to program efficiently.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>Small game in Haskell</h3>
            <p>Created in 4/5 weeks in groups of two. Haskell is not the most ideal for game development, but this was
                a mandatory
                requirement.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Software Design</h3>
            <p>Learned some useful design patterns such as Facade, Adapter, Strategy, Bridge, Abstract Factory,
                Decorator and Observer.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Cognition and Emotion</h3>
            <p>Cognitive psychology applied to Human Computer Interaction. In teams of 5, we have developed a Virtual
                Reality Language Learning application, which takes cognitive and emotional aspects into account by using
                Affective Computing.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Interaction Technology</h3>
            <p>Soldering and programming with an Arduino. For example, in teams of 2 we had to make a smart toilet
                freshner and a automatic watering plant (Internet of Things).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="gallery-small">
            <h3>Designing interactive systems</h3>
            <p>Learned about Human Factors, visual aspects and more. A big part of this course was to develop a mobile
                application for children (age 11-14) to gain insight in the effects of the Filter Bubble.</p>

            <h3>Bachelor End Project</h3>
            <p>In a group of 12 people (10 developers, 2 artists) we've created a serious game of the <a
                    href="https://www.ns.nl/" target="_blank" class="link1">Dutch Railways (NS)</a> in 5 months (1
                semester) using SCRUM with me as Scrum Master.</p>

            <h3>Car Search Engine</h3>
            <p>During my time at <a href="https://www.autocentrumvanvliet.nl/" target="_blank" class="link1">Van Vliet
                    Autogroep</a>, I've worked on a new car search engine which uses Angular and TypeScript. I mostly worked on the leasemode and some search filters. If you want, you can <a href="https://autos.vanvlietautogroep.nl/" target="_blank" class="link1">check it out yourself!</a></p>
