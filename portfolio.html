            <h3>Recreate an Old Retro Game</h3>
            <p>Together with 5 other students we've recreated an old retro game. This was created with C# and MonoGame in Visual
                Studio. Features: online/offline multiplayer, highscores, play against the computer. This is created in 10
                weeks.

            <h3>Webshop</h3>
            <p>My first client-server application: a webshop where you can browse, filter and buy products (not for real, but
                the idea remains the same). You could also create an account and login with that account. Created with Jade,
                CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js and AJAX.</p>

            <h3>Small game in Haskell</h3>
            <p>Created in 4/5 weeks in groups of two. Haskell is not the most ideal for game development, but this was a mandatory
                requirement.</p>
