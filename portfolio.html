            <h3>Recreate an Old Retro Game</h3>
            <h5 class="employer"><b>Employer: </b>Utrecht University (student)</h5>
            <p>Together with 5 other students we've recreated an old retro game. This was created with C# and MonoGame
                in Visual
                Studio. Features: online/offline multiplayer, highscores, play against the computer. This is created in
                10
                weeks.

            <h3>Webshop</h3>
            <h5 class="employer"><b>Employer: </b>Utrecht University (student)</h5>
            <p>My first client-server application: a webshop where you can browse, filter and buy products (not for
                real, but the idea remains the same). You could also create an account and login with that account.
                Created with
                Jade, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js and AJAX. Created in approximately 3 weeks in
                groups of two.</p>

            <h3>Small game in Haskell</h3>
            <h5 class="employer"><b>Employer: </b>Utrecht University (student)</h5>
            <p>Created in 4/5 weeks in groups of two. Haskell is not the most ideal for game development, but this was
                a mandatory
                requirement.</p>

            <p>In a group of 12 people (10 developers, 2 artists) we've created a serious game for the <a
                    href="https://www.ns.nl/" target="_blank" class="link1">Dutch Railways (NS)</a> in 5 months (1

            <h5 class="employer"><b>Employer: </b>Autocentrum Van Vliet</h5>
            <p>During my time at <a href="https://www.autocentrumvanvliet.nl/" target="_blank" class="link1">Van Vliet
                    Autogroep</a>, I've worked on a new car search engine which uses Angular and TypeScript. I mostly
                worked on the leasemode, some search filters and the different view modes. If you want, you can <a
